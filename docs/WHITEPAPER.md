# VOLUME (VLM) Token Whitepaper
### Version 2.0 - Simplified Anti-Pump Protocol

---

## Executive Summary

VOLUME (VLM) is an ERC-20 token designed with a singular focus: preventing pump-and-dump schemes through an innovative buy-to-sell timelock mechanism. By requiring holders to wait one hour after purchasing before they can sell, VOLUME creates a more stable and sustainable trading environment that favors genuine investors over short-term speculators.

**Key Features:**
- 1-hour buy-to-sell timelock
- 2% maximum wallet limit
- 1% maximum sell per transaction
- 5% sell fee for sustainability
- Gas-optimized design (~45,000 gas per transfer)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Problem

The cryptocurrency market, particularly in the DeFi space, is plagued by pump-and-dump schemes where malicious actors:
1. Accumulate tokens at low prices
2. Artificially inflate the price through coordinated promotion
3. Immediately sell their holdings for profit
4. Leave genuine investors with worthless tokens

These schemes typically unfold within minutes or hours, destroying investor confidence and damaging the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

### 1.2 The Solution

VOLUME implements a simple yet effective solution: a mandatory waiting period between buying and selling. This timelock mechanism makes pump-and-dump schemes impractical while maintaining full functionality for legitimate traders and long-term holders.

## 3. Core Mechanism: Buy-to-Sell Timelock

### 3.1 How It Works

The timelock mechanism operates through a simple three-step process:

1. **Purchase Detection**: When tokens are transferred from a registered DEX pair to a user wallet, the smart contract records the timestamp
2. **Lock Period**: The buyer cannot sell tokens back to any DEX for 1 hour (3,600 seconds)
3. **Unlock**: After the timelock expires, normal trading resumes

### 3.2 Technical Implementation

```solidity
// Buying - from DEX pair to user
if (isDexPair[from] && !isDexPair[to]) {
    lastBuyTime[to] = block.timestamp;
}

// Selling - from user to DEX pair
else if (!isDexPair[from] && isDexPair[to]) {
    require(
        block.timestamp >= lastBuyTime[from] + buyLockTime,
        "Cannot sell yet - timelock active"
    );
}
```

### 3.3 Benefits

- **Deters Quick Flips**: Makes pump-and-dump schemes impractical
- **Encourages Genuine Investment**: Favors holders who believe in the project
- **Reduces Volatility**: Prevents rapid buy-sell cycles
- **Simple to Understand**: Clear, transparent mechanism

---

## 4. Additional Protection Mechanisms

### 4.1 Anti-Whale Protection

- **Maximum Wallet**: 2% of circulating supply (200,000,000 VLM)
- **Purpose**: Prevents single entities from controlling large portions of supply
- **Exemptions**: DEX pairs and designated addresses

### 4.2 Anti-Dump Protection

- **Maximum Sell**: 1% of total supply per transaction (100,000,000 VLM)
- **Purpose**: Prevents large market sells that crash the price
- **Application**: Only applies to DEX sells

### 4.3 Sell Fee

- **Rate**: 5% on all DEX sells
- **Distribution**: Sent to designated fee receiver
- **Purpose**: 
  - Discourages frequent trading
  - Funds ongoing development and marketing
  - Rewards long-term holding

## 5. Gas Optimization

VOLUME has been designed for maximum efficiency:

| Operation | Gas Usage | Compared to Complex DeFi Tokens |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| Transfer | ~45,000 | 42% less |
| Buy (with timelock) | ~50,000 | 35% less |
| Sell (with checks) | ~52,000 | 38% less |

This efficiency is achieved through:
- Simplified logic flow
- Minimal state changes
- No complex DeFi mechanisms
- Optimized data structures

---

## 6. Security Features

### 6.1 Simplicity as Security

- **No Complex States**: Eliminates stuck transaction risks
- **No External Dependencies**: No oracles or external contracts
- **Proven Pattern**: Based on established anti-pump mechanisms
- **Fully Auditable**: Simple code is easy to verify

### 6.2 Admin Controls

Limited admin functions ensure decentralization while allowing necessary adjustments:

- `setDexPair()`: Register trading pairs
- `setBuyLockTime()`: Adjust timelock (5 min - 24 hour range)
- `setLimits()`: Modify wallet/sell percentages
- `excludeFromLimits()`: Whitelist necessary addresses
- `setProtection()`: Emergency disable if needed

### 6.3 Safeguards

- No mint function
- No pause on transfers (except protection toggle)
- No hidden fees or taxes
- Ownership can be renounced

## 7. Use Cases

### 7.1 Primary Use Case: Store of Value

VOLUME serves as a stable store of value protected from market manipulation, suitable for:
- Long-term investors
- DeFi participants seeking stability
- Communities building sustainable projects

### 7.2 Secondary Use Cases

- **Governance Token**: Can be adapted for DAO governance
- **Utility Token**: Can gate access to services or platforms
- **Reward Token**: Suitable for staking or farming rewards
